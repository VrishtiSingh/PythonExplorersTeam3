Overview of Datasets
The {avocado} package consists of three different datasets that summarize the weekly sales of Hass Avocados at different regional levels.

hass_usa: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the country level
hass_region: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the region level
hass: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the city/sub-region level
PLU
The product/price lookup code (PLU) uniquely identifies a product (mainly produce). The Hass Avocado Board focuses on six different PLUs:

4046: non-organic small/medium Hass Avocados (~3-5 oz)
4225: non-organic large Hass Avocados (~8-10 oz)
4770: non-organic extra large Hass Avocados (~10-15 oz)
94046: organic small/medium Hass Avocados (~3-5 oz)
94225: organic large Hass Avocados (~8-10 oz)
94770: organic extra large Hass Avocados
Bags vs PLU
Another distinction that the HAB makes is between bags versus bulk. Bulk typically means avocados sold as individual pieces and are easily distinguishable with their PLU codes. Hence, the PLU refers to a bulk sale. On the other hand, the bags indicates a pre-packaged container consisting of a variable number of avocados of mixed PLU type. For instance, a package of six avocados may consist of 2 PLU 4046, 3 PLU 4770 and 1 PLU 4225. In other words, bagged sales are unable to account for individual PLU sales.

Region vs. Location
The hass_region and hass datasets contain a shared variable called region and the hass dataset has a variable called location. Regions are defined by the Hass Avocado Board and Locations are selected cities or sub-regions that are part of the overall Region. The totals found for all locations within a Region will not equal the total found for the specific Region due to the aforementioned point. For convenience, here is a breakdown of the Regions and Locations:
