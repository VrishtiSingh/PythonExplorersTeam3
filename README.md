Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical avocado prices. The primary goal is to clean the dataset and explore trends, seasonal patterns, and potential factors affecting avocado prices, setting a foundation for future predictive modeling.

Objectives
Data Cleaning: Ensure data quality by handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, seasonal variations, and key differences in avocado prices by region and type (conventional vs. organic).
